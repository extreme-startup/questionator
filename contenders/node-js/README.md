# Node.js Contender

This is an example of contender application. 
It is ready to participate in Questionator's extreme startup using Javascript.

## How to start

It's easy, buddy! Just follow following steps:

1. Run the app with ``` npm run start```

2. Get your tunnel-url (```https://node-js-contender.localtunnel.me``` by default, could be changed in ```contender.json```)
 and register it in Questinator's extreme-startup.
 
3. Start getting questions and handle them in ```answer.js```. 
By default, question is expected to be a url query string  ```question``` parameter. Otherwise, you should adjust your ```contender.js```.    

That's all! Feel the start-up flavour and have fun.
